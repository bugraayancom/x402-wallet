## Security Best Practices

### Protecting Your Wallet

1. **Never share your private keys or seed phrase**
2. **Always verify recipient addresses before sending**
3. **Start with small test transactions for new recipients**
4. **Keep your wallet software updated**
5. **Use a hardware wallet for large amounts**

### Avoiding Scams

- **Phishing**: Never click links in unsolicited messages
- **Fake websites**: Always verify the URL (https://x402.org)
- **Too good to be true**: Be skeptical of "guaranteed" returns
- **Pressure tactics**: Legitimate projects won't rush you

### Transaction Safety

- **Double-check addresses**: One wrong character loses funds forever
- **Verify amounts**: Ensure you're sending the correct amount
- **Check gas fees**: Unusually high fees might indicate a problem
- **Review warnings**: Pay attention to security warnings
- **Test first**: Send a small amount first for large transfers

## Troubleshooting

### Wallet Won't Connect

- **Clear cache**: Try clearing your browser cache
- **Restart wallet**: Close and reopen your wallet extension
- **Try different browser**: Some wallets work better in specific browsers
- **Update wallet**: Make sure your wallet is up to date

### Transaction Failed

Common reasons:

- **Insufficient gas**: Increase gas price and try again
- **Insufficient balance**: Make sure you have enough for amount + gas
- **Network congestion**: Wait and try again during off-peak hours
- **Contract error**: The smart contract rejected the transaction

### Transaction Stuck

If a transaction is pending for too long:

1. Check block explorer for status
2. Try "Speed Up" option if available
3. Wait - sometimes it just takes longer during high traffic
4. Contact support if it's been more than 24 hours

### Balance Not Showing

- **Wait**: Sometimes it takes a few minutes to update
- **Refresh**: Click the refresh button
- **Switch networks**: Switch to another network and back
- **Check block explorer**: Verify the transaction completed
